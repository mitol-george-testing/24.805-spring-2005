At least one seminar presentation is required during the term. The paper should be 20-30 minutes in presentation time. An outline or handout must be prepared for distribution to all participants at the seminar in which it will be presented. Discussion will follow. A written version of the paper should be handed in no later than one week after your presentation. Please see [assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments) for possible topics.
